<IntroParagraph>
  Tamagui is a universal UI kit for React Native and Web, making it much easier to ship
  performant, beautiful apps across all platforms using the same code. It makes hard
  things easy - like themes, responsive styling, and animation.
</IntroParagraph>

**At its core are three libraries**:

<IntroParagraph>
  <UL>
    <LI>A style library (`@tamagui/core`) for creating React Native + Web components.</LI>
    <LI>An optimizing compiler (`@tamagui/static`) for incredible performance.</LI>
    <LI>A component kit (`tamagui`) built using both of the above.</LI>
  </UL>
</IntroParagraph>

It's been six monthsÂ since the first alpha, [several hundreds of bugfixes](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.0), [three demo apps](https://github.com/tamagui), ten new components, and now a few big new core features. Plus, a [refreshed site](/), a [benchmark suite](/docs/intro/benchmarks), a host of type improvements, and compatibility with more versions of Next.js, Webpack, and React Native.

What's new?

### Get started faster ðŸš€

Introducing [**create-tamagui**](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/tree/master/packages/create-tamagui), to get started much faster with a bootstrapped monorepo that uses Expo, Next.js, Solito and Tamagui:

```bash
npm create tamagui
```

A big shout out to [Fernando Rojo](https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo) for creating [Solito](https://solito.dev), a great library for sharing all your views between Expo and Next.js, and the bootstrap repo.
