<IntroParagraph large>
  React Native is amazing for building mobile apps, but sharing components between web and
  native [sacrifices performance, productivity and UX](/docs/intro/why-a-compiler).
</IntroParagraph>

<IntroParagraph>
  Tamagui introduces a novel optimizing compiler for React that evaluates your code at
  build-time, turning heavy JS into flatter trees and much faster CSS. The result is more
  code share %, less dev time, and lighter, faster apps.
</IntroParagraph>

Tamagui's optimizing compiler makes advanced optimizations using partial evaluation, CSS extraction, and ultimately tree-flattening. Where it optimizes, things get a lot faster:

Tamagui comes in three parts:

[**Tamagui Core**](#overview-of-tamaguicore) (`@tamagui/core`) is a style library for React Native and web that supports 100% of the React NativeÂ API surface in a library that only depends on React. It adds all the [goodies of modern style libraries](#overview) into a cohesive package.

[**Tamagui Static**](#overview-of-tamaguistatic) (`@tamagui/static`) is an optimizing compiler on top of Core, turning even inline styles sprinkled with logic into atomic CSS and minimal JS, flattening your view tree for maximum performance.

[**Tamagui UI**](#overview-of-tamagui) (`tamagui`) is a component kit built on top of the incredibly powerful theme primitives of `core`. That, alongside composable-component APIs and complete size control enables a new level of control not seen before in a UI kit.

## Overview

Lets get familiar with both `@tamagui/core` (the styling library) and `@tamagui/static` (the compiler), and how the latter optimizes the former.

The key to Tamagui's performance gains lie in **view flattening** or tree-flattening: the compiler analyzes code (even across module boundaries) and evaluates styled components away using both the AST and Node VM code evaluation. It will fully flatten custom styled components (like `<Circle />`) into plain old `<div />` (or `<View />` on native).
