Tamagui takes the next steps towards truly universal styling for React apps.

It was born to allow **sharing more code between native and web components** — with all the [modern styling features we've grown love](/docs/intro/introduction).

Until today, sharing code between native and web has had some big downsides — especially inline styling, responsive styling and themes. All of the above require time and memory-hungry operations in JavaScript. On the web, especially, this runs a lot of JS on the same thread as your layout, causing issues with jank and limitations rendering deeper trees.

**Tamagui introduces an optimizing compiler, enabling:**

### Inline styles without overhead

An optimizing compiler extracts most styles you write, for [**2-8x speed improvements**](/docs/intro/benchmarks) vs other cross-platform UI kits. Even if they're inside conditional ternaries or spread objects, it extracts styles out of your JS bundle and into atomic CSS.
